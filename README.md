# Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the Master's project "Quasi-Biennial Oscillations of Ozone and its Implications in Atmospheric Dynamics and Climate Stability" conducted at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford. Here you may download a MATLAB code that implements a one-dimensional model of the QBO. This model is an extension of Plumb's model to incorporate linearised equations of ozone radiation and photochemistry.
